I'm a developer who finds satisfaction in both creation and destruction—or, more accurately, deconstruction. I believe in the beauty of man-made chaos and the joy of figuring out how things work by taking them apart. This curiosity was heavily influenced by shows like **Mythbusters** and the creative spirit of Grant from **The King of Random**.

Professionally, my passion is building with clean, modern code. I work mainly in C/C++, Go, and Python, but I've also spent a considerable amount of time working with C# and Lua.

### A note on my tags

If your looking for my dev blogs like about what I am working on you want to use Devlog and if your looking for my talks about my journey you want to use devblog. 

The easiest way to think about it is that log my develop with a project under devlog, and I blog about the ideas under devblog.

### Notice of funding

I have both GitHub Sponsors and a Patreon that you can use if you want to. Most of the funding I get—if I don't need it for project costs—goes right back out to either open-source projects or things like the Internet Archive.

If you use Patreon, you can link your GitHub account and you'll automatically get the "Sponsor" perk here on GitHub.

I have a Ko-fi too, but it has really nothing on it and I don’t really know what to do with it yet.
