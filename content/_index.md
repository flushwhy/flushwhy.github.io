I'm a developer who finds satisfaction in both creation and destructionâ€”or, more accurately, deconstruction. I believe in the beauty of man-made chaos and the joy of figuring out how things work by taking them apart. This curiosity was heavily influenced by shows like **Mythbusters** and the creative spirit of Grant from **The King of Random**.

Professionally, my passion is building with clean, modern code. I work mainly in C/C++, Go, and Python, but I've also spent a considerable amount of time working with C# and Lua.
