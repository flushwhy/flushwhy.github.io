# FlushWhy 
I am just a guy who likes to make and take things a part. I enjoy destruction and man created choas like anyother dude. 

Some of my biggest influsences are Mybusters, and Grant from The King Of Random YT channel.

I am really big into nice clean modern code. I use C/C++, GO, and Python mostly. I do have a lot of time in C# and Lua tho.
